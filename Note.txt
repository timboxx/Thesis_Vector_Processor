memory_generator: contains program_memory.py, used as the assembler. The input pipe is the assembly_code.txt and the output pipe is the code_out.coe
	Instructions written to assembly_code.txt are converted into machine code. The code_out.coe is stored on data memory.
	the folder others conatains undocumented programming scripts used to issue tcl commands or store random values into data memory in float or integer representation


VFU_MEM_FINAL.rar - contains the vector floating-point processor project for Vivado version 2020.2
		To program, the device use hardware manager and press program device. Then press the play on the debugger tool to obtain vector results. Probes need to be added in the probe list. 



Benchmark.rar : gold/src contains assembly_vector_float.s which is the benchmark for VFP
				assembly.s is the benchmark for ARM Cortex-R5 CPU

the program might need to be generated using platform generated application. if being debugged on a new system. To access VFP use of the preproccesr command line instruction mention in the dissertation needs to be used.

the platform for arm-cortex r5 can be generated through the project_1 folder.
